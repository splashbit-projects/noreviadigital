At Norevia Digital ("we," "our," or "the Company"), we prioritize professional integrity and transparent cooperation. While our services are tailored to deliver measurable outcomes, we recognize there may be circumstances where a refund is requested. This policy outlines the conditions, processes, and limitations regarding refunds.

## **Conditions for Refund Eligibility**

Refunds are only possible within **30 calendar days** from the date of the original payment, provided that:

- **Work on the service case has not yet commenced.**
- Initial discussions, consultations, or clarification sessions **do not constitute service provision**.
- If any **actual services**—such as analytics, research, market study, account reviews, documentation drafting, or case execution—have begun, the refund is no longer applicable.

Once a project has entered the **execution phase**, the order is **non-refundable**, even if it is within the 30-day window.

## **Non-Refundable Scenarios**

Refunds will **not be issued** under the following conditions:

- Work on the case has started as defined above.
- The refund request is submitted more than 30 days after the payment.
- The client fails to provide the necessary documentation to verify payment or order.

There are **no additional administrative fees** or cancellation charges for eligible refunds.

## **How to Request a Refund**

To initiate a refund request, please email us at **info@noreviadigital.com** and include the following:

- Full name and company (if applicable)
- Service description or Order ID
- Proof of payment: payment confirmation, bank transfer receipt, or processor-issued confirmation

Refund decisions are communicated within **5 business days** after submission.

## **Refund Processing Time**

Once a refund is approved and both parties confirm the eligible amount, the funds will be returned using the **same payment method**. Under no circumstances can the refund be sent to an alternative payment channel.

Please allow up to **15 business days** for the refunded amount to reflect, depending on your financial institution.

## **Disputes and Limitations**

By ordering any service from Norevia Digital, you **fully acknowledge and accept this Refund Policy**. If you disagree with the stated conditions, you must **negotiate custom refund terms in writing before payment**.

We do not entertain post-payment disputes concerning refund eligibility when those terms have not been discussed or modified in advance.
