## **Use of Content and Intellectual Property**

All text, visuals, graphics, documents, and other material (“Content”) on our website or shared through our services may include third-party content and client-submitted materials (“Client Content”).

Company-owned content (“Norevia Content”) and any third-party licensed material may not be reproduced, republished, distributed, or shared without written permission. All trademarks, service marks, logos, and design elements remain the intellectual property of their respective owners.

## **Disclaimer of Liability and Warranty**

All information is provided “as is” without guarantees of completeness, timeliness, or accuracy. Norevia Digital disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement. Using any content, tools, or services is at your own risk.

We do not warrant the website or services being error-free or continuously available. Technical disruptions, scheduled maintenance, or third-party service failures may occur without prior notice.

You must be at least 18 years old to use our services. You cannot engage with our website or services if you are under this age. If any data from a minor is submitted in error, please notify us for prompt deletion.

## **Privacy & Data Use**

By using our services or submitting any form of content or personal data, you consent to the processing, storing, and sharing of such data as outlined in our Privacy Policy. We retain the right to access and disclose user data where necessary to comply with legal obligations or protect our rights, services, or users.

You may withdraw consent at any time by contacting our team. Message and data rates may apply depending on your provider.

## **External Resources & Links**

Our website may contain links to third-party websites. These are provided for convenience only and do not signify endorsement. We are not responsible for any external content or downloads' accuracy, reliability, or safety.

## **Modifications to Terms**

Norevia Digital reserves the right to amend these Terms at any time. Changes will take immediate effect upon publication on our website. Continued use of the website or services confirms your acceptance of any updates.

## **Cancellation Policy and Termination**

Norevia Digital OU reserves the right to refuse or discontinue service at any time and in its sole discretion. This includes—but is not limited to—cases involving suspected abuse of promotional offers, violation of acceptable use, or breach of these Terms.

Orders may be eligible for cancellation and refund if requested before funds are allocated to external service providers (such as advertising platforms or third-party partners). In such cases, a processing or cancellation fee may apply. Once funds have been transferred or services have been initiated through external channels, cancellations or changes are no longer possible.

Norevia Digital does not contest valid chargebacks. However, should a chargeback be initiated after confirmed service delivery or platform payment, we reserve the right to take any appropriate countermeasures, including suspension or permanent termination of service.

We may suspend, limit, or revoke access to our services without prior notice if a user is found to misuse the platform, infringe on intellectual property rights, transmit spam or malicious content, or engage in activities deemed incompatible with our ethical and operational standards.

## **Lawful Use**

By engaging with Norevia Digital Services, you confirm that you will not use the website or any associated materials, products, or services for unlawful or fraudulent activities. This includes, but is not limited to, falsifying data, misrepresenting identity or legal intent, or attempting to bypass legal, tax, or regulatory frameworks.

Any violation of this principle may result in immediate termination of services. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Norevia Digital, its directors, partners, employees, and affiliated service providers against all claims, liabilities, or expenses arising from unlawful or unethical use of our services.

Norevia Digital reserves the right to investigate complaints, violations, or suspicious activity. This includes sharing relevant user data (such as email addresses, submitted documents, usage logs, or IP addresses) with legal authorities or regulatory agencies as the law requires.

You also agree not to use automated tools, bots, scripts, or crawlers to access any portion of the website or services, nor attempt to bypass security controls or submit misleading, inaccurate, or inappropriate content.

## **Limitation of Liability**

Your use of Norevia Digital's services is at your own risk. The company assumes no liability for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages — including but not limited to lost profits, business interruptions, or data loss.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total liability under these Terms shall not exceed the lesser of (i) the total fees paid by you to Norevia Digital within the 12 months preceding the claim or (ii) EUR 100.

This limitation applies to all legal claims, including contract, tort, negligence, or otherwise, regardless of theory.

## **Waiver and Release**

By using our services, you agree to release Norevia Digital OU and its associated entities from any known or unknown claims related to your access to or use of the services or website content.

You also acknowledge that third-party services fulfilled on our behalf (including auto-renewals or network placements) are non-refundable once processed, even if the outcome does not meet personal expectations.

## **Indemnification**

You agree to indemnify and defend Norevia Digital OU, its management, affiliates, employees, contractors, and partners against any legal claims, costs, damages, or liabilities resulting from:

- Your content or use of the services
- Any breach of these Terms
- Any violation of applicable laws or regulations
- Any infringement of third-party rights
- Misrepresentations or inaccurate information provided by you

You agree to cooperate fully with us in any legal defense. Norevia Digital retains the right to assume exclusive legal control in such matters. You must not agree to any settlements without our prior written approval.

## **Governing Law and Dispute Resolution**

The laws of the Republic of Estonia govern these Terms.

In the event of a dispute, you agree to first attempt resolution through direct contact with Norevia Digital. If the matter remains unresolved, any claims or proceedings must be brought exclusively before the courts of Tallinn, Estonia.

The parties agree that these courts may award actual damages and legal costs where applicable but shall not grant punitive or consequential damages except in fraudulent activity or malicious conduct.

You further agree that if any legal action is initiated outside of Estonia, you will be liable for all legal expenses incurred by Norevia Digital in response.

## **General Provisions**

### **Severability**

If any part of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable, it shall be modified only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. All other provisions shall remain in effect.

### **Entire Agreement**

These Terms and our Privacy Policy represent the complete agreement between you and Norevia Digital regarding the use of the services. They supersede any prior verbal or written agreements.

### **No Implied Waiver**

Failure to enforce any part of these Terms does not waive our right to enforce them later. No verbal or informal modification to these Terms shall be considered binding.

### **Assignment**

You may not assign or transfer your rights under these Terms without our express written consent. Norevia Digital may assign its obligations and rights under these Terms at any time, including in the event of a merger or reorganization.
