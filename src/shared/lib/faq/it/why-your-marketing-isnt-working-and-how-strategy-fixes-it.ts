    description:
      'A strategy defines what you’re trying to achieve and why—a plan outlines how you’ll get there. Strategy is the compass, the plan is the map.',

  {
    title: '2. Why do so many campaigns look good on the surface but don’t drive growth?',

    title: '3. Can I build a strategy without a huge budget or team?',

    title: '4. Should I start with channels or with positioning?',
    description:
      'Always start with positioning. Channels only matter if your message resonates with the right people.',
